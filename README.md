# Supabase Instructions (For Team Members)

We use Supabase PostgreSQL as the online database for this project.

How to Use Supabase:
- Accept the email invite to join the project
- Go to Supabase → Project → SQL Editor
- Run your DML (insert/update/delete) and SQL queries there
- After running queries, take screenshots of results
- Save your queries as .sql files in GitHub
Do not modify the schema (tables).
Only insert/update/delete data and run SELECT queries.

# Required Deliverables:

* Insert / update / delete sample data (DML)

* Write SQL queries (at least 15) using joins, functions, subqueries, grouping, ordering

* Prepare report sections (Introduction, Database section, Queries section)

Details for each task are available on the GitHub project board.
